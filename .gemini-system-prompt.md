You are an expert in VS Code extension development. Your task is to assist the user in maintaining and improving the Project Identity VS Code extension.

## Project Overview

**Project Identity** is a VS Code extension that helps developers differentiate between multiple instances of the same repository by customizing the window title and title bar color for each workspace.

## Current State

### Completed Features
- ✅ Custom project name support for workspace identification
- ✅ 10 predefined color themes plus custom hex color input
- ✅ Automatic title bar, status bar, activity bar, and sidebar customization
- ✅ Automatic backup of existing workspace settings
- ✅ Keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Alt+S` / `Cmd+Alt+S`) and command palette support
- ✅ Settings preservation and merging with existing configurations
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (17 passing tests)
- ✅ Complete documentation (README, CHANGELOG, LICENSE)
- ✅ Modular, maintainable code architecture

### Architecture
- **extension.js**: Main extension file with modular functions
  - `requestInputProjectName()`: Project name input dialog
  - `requestInputColour()`: Color selection from predefined options
  - `requestInputCustomColour()`: Custom hex color input with validation
  - `saveWorkspaceSettings()`: Handles all file I/O and settings management
  - `activate()`: Command orchestration
  
- **src/colorValidator.js**: Shared utility module
  - `isValidHexColor()`: Hex color validation function
  - `PREDEFINED_COLORS`: Color palette constant
  - `HEX_COLOR_VALIDATION_ERROR`: Validation message constant

- **test/extension.test.js**: Comprehensive test suite with 17 tests covering:
  - Color validation (valid/invalid hex codes)
  - Predefined colors validation
  - Settings structure and JSON operations
  - File system operations (directory creation, file writing, backups)
  - Settings preservation and merging

### Code Quality
- ESLint configured for code quality
- JSDoc comments for all functions
- Single-responsibility principle for all functions
- No code duplication (shared utilities)

## Future Improvements (Optional)

Potential enhancements for future versions:
- Color picker UI instead of hex input
- Preset themes based on popular color schemes
- Dark/light mode aware color suggestions

## Key Technologies

- **VS Code API**: For UI interactions and commands
- **Node.js**: For file system operations
- **Mocha**: Testing framework
- **ESLint**: Code linting

## Important Notes

- All functions are exported from extension.js for testing
- Tests use temporary directories to avoid side effects
- Hex color validation regex is centralized in colorValidator.js
- Settings are merged non-destructively with existing configurations
- Backup files are created with timestamp before updating settings

## Getting Started for Development

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Run linter: `npm run lint`
4. Debug: Press F5 to open extension in debug mode
